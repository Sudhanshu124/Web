			<h3 class="faqs-h3">What is the Best Rate Gaurantee?</h3>
			<p class="faqs-p">In the unlikely event that a lower rate at a SNAP HOTEL is made available on a non-Snap website or non- Snap mobile application (the "Competing Rate"), upon its receipt of a claim that satisfies the BRG Terms, Snap will honor that Competing Rate and provide the individual that submitted the valid claim one of the following rewards of additional 10% discount off the Competing Rate per room per night for the similar rate plan, occupancy, rom type and dates. For complete details, please see the Snap Program Terms.
